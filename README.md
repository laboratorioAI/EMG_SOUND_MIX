# EMG_SOUND_MIX

# Introduction
We have developed an application that uses Matlab and Reaper to interact through hand gestures.
Reaper is audio editing software.
Using a gesture recognition system developed in a previous research, we have created an application that allows you to control audio tracks through hand gestures.

## Matlab App

The Classifier to implement the App is located in the following link:

## OSC Matlab

In Reaper and Matlab, the same IP address and port number parameters must be configured.

## Gestures Info
The gestures to be performed are mapped to actions in Reaper accordingly the following image
